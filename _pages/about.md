## Basic Info

***
- China - Shanghai
- GitHub: [Chi-Shan0707](https://github.com/Chi-Shan0707)


I am currently an undergraduate student at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University, pursuing a double degree in Information and Computing Science and Artificial Intelligence.<br>
At the same time, I have been actively self-studying interesting topics across computer science.<br>
I am exploring the intersection I truly want to work on and study.<br>
I hope to contribute to making society better.<br>

## My research interests

Currently, I am exploring the mathematical foundations of intelligence in large models and sequential decision-making. More specifically, I want to delve deeper into these areas through **Reinforcement Learning** methods.<br>
See more of my motivation on my [plan](/plan/) page.

## My featured works

I enjoy building small but complete research systems, writing technical notes, and turning vague ideas into runnable artifacts.

### [Cot-Knot](https://github.com/Chi-Shan0707/cot-knot)

**A paper repository on the domain-conditioned semantics of self-correction in chain-of-thought.**

<details>
<summary>Overview</summary>

Cot-Knot investigates whether "self-correction" in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning acts as a universal quality signal or if it is heavily domain-conditioned. By taking a structural measurement perspective, the project shifts the focus from standard verifier benchmarking to scrutinizing the validity of the annotation protocols themselves across Math and Coding domains.

The central finding is that "self-correction" does not behave identically across domains. While math "knots" (explicit, text-visible local state breaks) reliably predict correctness, originally formulated coding "knots" are annotation-invalid and predictively weak. To resolve this, the project proposes a replacement protocol based on execution-semantic breaks, improving both conceptual precision and annotation agreement.

<!-- ### [SVDomain](https://github.com/Chi-Shan0707/SVDomain)

**I propose SVDomain : a domain-conditioned low-rank framework for chain-of-thought analysis.**

<details>
<summary>Overview</summary>

SVDomain is a domain-conditioned low-rank framework that builds feature views from token-level confidence and uncertainty statistics, trajectory summaries, and availability indicators, and learns a shared latent basis with a lightweight linear readout.

- Canonical pipeline: StandardScaler → TruncatedSVD → LogisticRegression
- Downstream tasks: EarlyStop, Best-of-N bridging, RL checkpoint ranking.
- Focus: when low-rank structure becomes predictive, how bases transfer across anchors, and how the same low-rank object can support both prediction and explanation.

This repository contains a paper-style writeup and code to reproduce experiments and analyses.

### [TinyLoRA-GRPO-Coder](https://github.com/Chi-Shan0707/TinyLoRA-GRPO-Coder)

**Low-parameter adaptation and reinforcement learning for code generation.**

<details>
<summary>Overview</summary>

An independent open-source reimplementation and adaptation of TinyLoRA + GRPO from [Learning to Reason in 13 Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04118), migrated from math reasoning to verifiable competitive-programming code generation. Built on Qwen2.5-Coder-3B with only a tiny number of shared trainable parameters, the project uses real compile-and-run rewards rather than static heuristics. I developed the full pipeline end to end, including data processing, training, multi-GPU setup, reward design, evaluation, and validation, which significantly strengthened my ability to turn a paper into a working research system.

## My repos

- The following projects were primarily completed independently, with AI used only as an auxiliary tool where appropriate. These works were not conducted under a laboratory or research group; rather, they reflect my self-directed exploration, sustained learning, and independent implementation outside a formal research environment.

<!-- - The following project was completed in collaboration with others.
<details>
<summary><a href="https://github.com/Chi-Shan0707/NAD_Next" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAD Next</a></summary>

<p>A collaborative framework for analyzing large-language-model neuron activations and reasoning processes. The project covers activation-cache construction, selector evaluation, token-level statistics, and visualization. Our goal is to compare different runs on the same problem via CoT-, activation-, and ensemble-based signals, and estimate which run is more likely to be correct or incorrect.</p>

<p>My primary contribution: algorithm construction and method design.</p>

> Note: This project is currently a work in progress (WIP). Due to practical constraints, some content cannot be open-sourced on GitHub immediately; therefore, the current public repository is not yet complete. We will continue to add materials and update toward a more complete release as conditions permit.
